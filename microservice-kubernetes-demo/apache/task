📄 Custom Load Balancer
🔹 Project Goal
Build or extend a Load Balancer (LB) to distribute traffic across microservices
deployed on Kubernetes or bare metal.
🔹 Basic Roadmap
Phase 1: Understanding & Setup
● Study the basics of Load Balancing and its role in real deployments.
● Explore existing open-source LB tools for reference.
● Choose a microservice use-case (e.g., Payment System, IoT, Analytics,
Streaming).
● Decide on your base open-source tool.
● Plan deployment(Kubernetes or bare metal) (pods, services).
Phase 2: Core Implementation
● Implement essential LB features (routing, failover, etc.).
● Integrate with databases + storage backend.
● Deploy chosen microservices on Kubernetes with scaling.
Phase 3: Enhancement & Testing
● Add monitoring, logging, and dashboards.
● Run stress tests (latency, throughput, failover simulation).
● Optimize and demonstrate autoscale up/down (bonus points).🔹 Target Features
👉 You can use an existing Load Balancer and extend it by adding new features or
improving existing ones.
Default / Must-Have Features
●
●
●
●
Routing strategies (round-robin, weighted, least-connections).
Health checks & failover handling.
TLS termination (basic SSL support).
Traffic distribution across Kubernetes services.
Optional / Differentiating Features (choose a few to stand out)
●
●
●
●
●
●
Content-aware routing (e.g., based on headers, URL paths).
Sticky sessions (session affinity).
Rate limiting or connection throttling.
Multi-cluster routing (across different namespaces/clusters).
Intelligent scaling (auto-adjusting replicas based on LB metrics).
Observability hooks (export metrics to Prometheus/Grafana).
🔹 Storage & Database Options
Each project must integrate with at least one database (SQL or NoSQL) and one
distributed storage option(Open source only).
● Relational DB (SQL): PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
● Non-Relational DB (NoSQL): Cassandra, HBase, etc.
● Distributed Storage:
■ Object: Ceph RGW, MinIO, Ozone, SeaweedFS
■ File: CephFS, SeaweedFS.
■ Block: Ceph RBD, ZFS/LVM-backed volumes🔹 Expectations
Mid Review (First Meet)
●
●
●
●
Minimal working LB (basic routing + health check).
Clear choice of microservice use-case with design diagram.
Prototype running on Kubernetes (single-node acceptable).
Connected to at least one storage backend.
Final Review
Fully functional Load Balancer with target features implemented.
Kubernetes deployment with scaling + autoscaling (bonus for scale-down).
End-to-end demo:
[Client] → [Gateway] → [Custom LB] → [Microservices] → [DB
+ Storage]
● Performance benchmarking & final documentation.
